## Adding Scenario Names to `config.yaml`

1. Navigate to the `config.yaml` file within the `PyPSA-earth-lit/pages/utils/` directory.

2. In the `config.yaml` file, locate the section under `scenario_names`. Here, you will find predefined test scenario names.

3. Add your resulting scenario names to this section, providing user-friendly names for each scenario. This crucial step establishes the connection between **PyPSA-Earth-Lit** and your **PyPSA-Earth** scenarios.

By adding scenario names and corresponding user-friendly names to the `config.yaml` file, you enable **PyPSA-Earth-Lit** to seamlessly access and visualize the data generated by your **PyPSA-Earth** project.
